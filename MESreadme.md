# Market Emotion Strategy (MES) — Learning Guide

## 🧩 Overview
**MES v1.6** transforms single-timeframe emotion analysis into a **multi-layer sentiment map** (15M / 1H / 4H).  
It helps traders visually understand how market emotions evolve — from short-term fear to long-term confidence — using multi-timeframe alignment.

---

## 🧭 1️⃣ 4H Layer — The “Institutional Mood”
- Represents **macro sentiment**; smooths out short-term noise.
- Reflects market’s **longer-term conviction**.
- Example: 4H shows *Greed ↑*, 15M shows *Fear ↓* → likely short-term pullback inside a bullish structure.
- When all TFs show *Fear ↓*, it signals a unified sentiment flush (capitulation).

### Learning Benefit
You learn to correlate how **short-term flips** (15M) often forecast **macro mood changes (4H)** — building rhythm awareness.

---

## 🧩 2️⃣ 1H Layer — The “Trend Filter”
- Bridges the gap between 15M and 4H views.
- Confirms whether 15M emotion aligns with the **mid-term direction**.
- Example: 1H = *Confidence ↑* while 15M = *Fear ↓* → pullback, not trend break.

### Learning Benefit
You train to **wait for emotional synchronization** between 15M + 1H before acting — key to filtering noise.

---

## ⚡ 3️⃣ 15M Layer — The “Tactical Mood”
- Captures **real-time sentiment shifts**.
- Useful for spotting **first emotional reversals** before larger TFs respond.
- Example: sudden 15M *Fear ↓* may hint at exhaustion or intraday overreaction.

### Learning Benefit
Sharpens your ability to **spot short-term emotion spikes** and study which reversals matter.

## 🔄 4️⃣ Multi-Timeframe Integration — “Sentiment Map”
- The `useMTF` logic merges emotions from all TFs.
- When all align → stronger sentiment conviction.
- When they diverge → signals hesitation or transitions.

### Learning Benefit
You’ll visually connect **how emotions cascade through timeframes**:
- 4H → conviction trend  
- 1H → confirmation trend  
- 15M → reaction layer

This deepens your **market psychology understanding** and helps develop **multi-timeframe reading discipline**.

---

## 📊 Bonus — Sentiment Sync Index (SSI)
Use the optional SSI block to score alignment from −3 (bearish) → +3 (bullish).  
This helps visualize harmony or conflict across TFs — making emotional structure instantly clear.
