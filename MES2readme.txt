🧭 1️⃣ 4 H Layer — The “Institutional Mood”

Acts as your macro sentiment base.

Because 4 H averages dozens of lower bars, its volume & range ratios smooth out transient spikes.

You can read it as the market’s longer-term confidence or fear.

If 4 H shows Greed / Confidence ↑ but 15 M flashes Fear ↓, it’s usually a pullback inside a bullish bias — a good chance to study reversals that don’t break structure.

When all TFs show Fear ↓ together, that’s a unified sentiment flush (capitulation).

🪄 Learning angle:
You’ll start to visually correlate when short-term sentiment flips first, often forecasting 4 H changes — great for learning market rhythm.

🧩 2️⃣ 1 H Layer — The “Trend Filter”

Sits in the middle; it bridges day-trader and swing perspectives.

Helps you test whether a 15 M emotion aligns or contradicts the mid-term flow.

In your dock: when 1 H = Confidence ↑ while 15 M = Fear ↓, you’re seeing retracement vs. breakout distinction.

Useful for practicing multi-TF confirmation entries (e.g., trade only if 15 M emotion agrees with 1 H).

🪄 Learning angle:
You can train your eye to wait for emotional synchronization between 15 M + 1 H before trusting a setup — exactly how pro traders avoid over-reacting to noise.

⚡ 3️⃣ 15 M Layer — The “Tactical Mood”

This is your real-time pulse, most reactive to volume surges and candle aggression.

Great for catching the first sign of sentiment shift before it echoes on 1 H/4 H.

Its high sensitivity lets you study market overreactions—e.g., sudden fear spikes that soon fade.

🪄 Learning angle:
By watching 15 M emotions change first, you’ll learn how short-term panic or greed appears visually before the higher-TF confirms or ignores it.
This builds pattern recognition — seeing which 15 M emotions truly matter vs. which are noise.

🔄 4️⃣ Integration Logic — Why It’s Powerful

Your conditional logic if useMTF merges moods: a 4 H/1 H/15 M agreement strengthens trade confidence.

If you’re learning sentiment alignment, this is gold:

When all TFs show Hope → Confidence → Greed = strong uptrend.

When 15 M flips Fear while 1 H still Confidence = probable pullback.

When 4 H and 1 H stay Fear even as 15 M turns Hope = weak rally / dead-cat bounce.

🧮 The dock table lets you see that conflict live, which is a great study tool.
